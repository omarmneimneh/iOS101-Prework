Submitted by: **Omar Mneimneh**

**iOS101 S25** is an app that contains 3 labels that serve as a brief introduction about me, along with a button that changes the color of the background when clicked

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    - Instagram:
        - Reels
        - Seemless transition between chats -> reels -> feed and vice versa
    - Spotify:
        - AI Smart Shuffle Feature
        - Curated monthly playlists
    - TikTok:
        - Infinite Scroll
        - Differentiating between For You/Friends
    
    An app idea that I have is to create an app that combines the functions from these apps to allow for easier sharing of music. Essentially, the app would combine the features of Instagram reels and TikTok's infinite scroll, but instead of it being videos, it would be people's favorite parts of a song. There can be comment sections for people to possibly discuss the music or create engagement as well. This could help people find new music even easier than something like Spotify's curated playlists from a function like a "For You Page" where anyone and their music can end up there. 
    
        

## Notes

The only challenges I really faced with this was learning how to interact with xCode.
